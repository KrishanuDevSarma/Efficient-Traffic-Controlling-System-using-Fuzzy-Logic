# Efficient-Traffic-Controlling-System-using-Fuzzy-Logic

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Traffic congestion is a major problem in urban areas. This project presents a **fuzzy logic-based intelligent traffic light controller**, which takes real-time inputs such as the number of waiting and incoming vehicles, and outputs the optimal wait time using fuzzy inference.

The system consists of:
- **Fuzzification** of crisp inputs (number of waiting and incoming cars)
- **Rule-based inference** using fuzzy logic
- **Defuzzification** to generate a crisp output (wait time in seconds)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- scikit-fuzzy
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for optional visualization)
